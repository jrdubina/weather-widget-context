### Built Project

I have prebuilt the project, so you just need to unzip and open the index.html inside the build folder.

The only view I focused on was the desktop view. It should still be mobile friendly, however I didnt alter anything on mobile since the directions and mock ups didnt provide that.

Additionally, I didn't write any form validation or exception handling. Again, instructions didnt provide any detailed instruction. If this had been a feature I recieved, I would ask for clarity or modified acceptance criteria. 

I have two zips, one is the project built in class components and another is the same project created in a modern functional react using context.

Thanks!
